# 🚀 Vector Databases for AI – Learning Journey

Just wrapped up the **[Vector Databases for AI](https://www.udemy.com/course/vector-databases-ai/?couponCode=MT300725A)** course on Udemy! 🎓

## 🧠 What I Learned

I've been diving deep into how LLM-based apps actually "remember" and "retrieve" information — and this course gave me a clear, hands-on understanding of vector databases and how they power features like **semantic search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

### 🧩 Core Concepts
- A **user query** is transformed into a **vector (embedding)** using models like `Sentence-BERT`, capturing its **semantic meaning**.
- These vectors are then **stored** in a **vector database** such as:
  - `Chroma`
  - `Pinecone`
  - `Weaviate`
- On receiving a new query:
  - It's converted to a vector.
  - The system searches for **similar vectors** in the database.
  - It returns **contextually relevant** results — even if the query doesn't match the exact wording.
