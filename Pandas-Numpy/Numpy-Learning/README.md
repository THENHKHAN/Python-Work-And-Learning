## 📌 Why NumPy is Better Than Python Lists

NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. Compared to traditional Python lists, NumPy offers several practical advantages:

### ✅ 1. Performance (Speed)
- NumPy arrays are significantly faster than Python lists for large datasets.
- Internally, NumPy uses optimized C code for operations, reducing computation time.
- **Example:** Operations like element-wise addition, multiplication are vectorized and much faster than using loops.

### ✅ 2. Memory Efficiency
- NumPy arrays consume less memory than lists.
- Python lists store references to objects, whereas NumPy arrays store data in a contiguous block of memory with fixed data types.

### ✅ 3. Functionality & Ease of Use
- NumPy provides a rich set of mathematical, logical, and statistical functions.
- Operations can be applied on entire arrays without writing loops.
- **Example:** `np.mean(arr)`, `np.sum(arr)`, `arr * 2`, etc.

### ✅ 4. Multidimensional Support
- NumPy natively supports multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., matrices and tensors).
- Python lists require nested structures and are harder to manipulate for higher dimensions.
